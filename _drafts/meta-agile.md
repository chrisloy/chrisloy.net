In my career, I have so far spent far more time working in teams that claim to be Agile than those which do not, and yet in that time I have only once worked in a team which claimed it was doing Agile "by the book". Many working in software claim to embrace the spirit of Agile only when it is appropriate, and not to let it "get in the way" or "slow down productivity". There is a sense that being fast and loose with the approaches of Agile will empower a team to produce better results, while strict adherence to an Agile doctrine would lead only to an empty set of processes. I would argue that few who claim such thinking are accurate in understanding their own team's practices, and broadly fall into two categories: those who are inadvertently still embracing Agile without realising it, and those who have truly abandoned it and do not see what it is costing them.

Before examining this subject in more detail, I think it is worth restating the four priorities of the Agile Manifesto. Usually they are unnumbered; I number them here to more easily reference them below:

1. _Individuals and interactions over processes and tools_
2. _Working software over comprehensive documentation_
3. _Customer collaboration over contract negotiation_
4. _Responding to change over following a plan_

These are the central tenets underpinning all attempts to establish processes, and are a useful touchstone to return to when examining whether a certain practice is Agile. The manifesto then uses these priorities to establish twelve principles that at a high level dictate how a team might approach embracing these ideals, but the

Many who claim to be deliberately straying from the Agile rulebook are in fact merely straying from a strict implementation of the Scrum methodology, an early implementation of the Agile principles as a project management methodology. It is worth noting that even in Scrum itself, almost all official literature advises against a dogmatic approach, instead suggesting the tailoring of the processes to suit the needs of the team. It is even more crucial to fully absorb that Agile is not Scrum, and in many ways, Scrum is not Agile. If you want proof of this, look at point **1** above, and ask whether the processes built in Scrum really play second fiddle to individuals and interactions.
