In 2007, I left university with a degree in Physics, a desire to set out on my own but little real direction. Strong in mathematics (although not strong enough to have excelled in a difficult course), I was looking for technical work with good prospects and a long term challenge. Mostly I was looking for a job.

Five months of unemployment may not sound like much, but it can feel like an entire lifetime slipping through your fingers. Idealism gave way to pragmatism, and desperation could certainly be seen on the horizon. I was rejected for jobs variously in project management, weather forecasting and IT support; each now feels like a bullet dodged. Jobseeker yes, but it is not possible to work full time on trying to gain employment. To improve my prospects, I tried to flesh out a minimal skill for programming I had acquired late in my degree. I bought _Java for Dummies_ and started working my way through it.

Circumstance, one open-minded hiring manager and some residual interview skills (honed four years previously when applying to Oxford) conspired to produce a job offer at the other end of the country. I hastily accepted it, booked five nights in a budget hotel and bought a one-way train ticket. I was a software engineer.

Always be crazy

Let me start with a confession. I am not a computer person, not a geek, not a tech head, and until it became my profession I was not an habitual coder. This is my profession, not my life. It is a profession which in many ways I love, at which I feel I have a natural aptitude, in which I am driven to excel and which has relentlessly spread its roots into every other aspect of my life. At this point, I think as clearly in code as I do in language or mathematics. I code for fun in my free time. My entire social circle is comprised of either people in software or those I have met through them. But this is effect and not cause.

The software industry prizes above all else the bedroom coder. The impossible ideal to which all software engineers (loaded term - more of that later) must as aspire to is that of a young, white, male (more on that too) mathematical genius who has been sat in his bedroom since the age of 12, writing websites, games, hacking and cracking for fun, with an encyclopaedic knowledge of the Linux kernel, GPU programming, every browser Javascript bug and five years experience in whatever the latest six-month-old fad is (Mongo, Node, Docker...).

I will talk about the industry's issues with sexism and racism (along with ableism, transphobia and the rest) below, but consider the remainder of that list. More than enough has been written by aggrieved software engineers, casually disregarding their massive privilege and wealth and moaning about how the above is an impossible ideal which no one can ever achieve. I have no intention of flailing my arms around in a tantrum about how difficult it has been for me to meet such obscene standards of constant technical omniscience and adroitness. Every field has its own ludicrous notion of perfection - and each is equally frustrating and unachievable. This phenomenon within software has been endless covered (_Ask HN: Why does no one realise how marvellous I am?_). I want instead to talk about how damaging the goal is, not because of the ego-bruising or psychological harm done to individuals but because of the direction it pulls the industry.

I have worked with people who reasonably closely fit the description above. They were uniformly terrible.
