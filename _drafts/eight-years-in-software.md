In 2007, I left university with a degree in Physics, a desire to set out on my own but little real direction. Strong in mathematics (although not strong enough to have excelled in a difficult course), I was looking for technical work with good prospects and a long term challenge. Mostly I was looking for a job.

Five months of unemployment may not sound like much, but it can feel like an entire lifetime slipping through your fingers. Idealism gives way to pragmatism, and the shadow of desperation looms on the horizon. I was rejected for jobs variously in project management, weather forecasting and IT support; each now feels like a bullet dodged. Jobseeker yes, but I soon learnt that it is not possible to work full time on trying to gain employment. To improve my prospects, I tried to flesh out a minimal skill for programming I had acquired late in my degree. I bought _Java for Dummies_ and started working my way through it.

Circumstance, one open-minded hiring manager and some residual interview skills (honed four years previously when applying to Oxford) conspired to produce a job offer at the other end of the country. I hastily accepted it, booked five nights in a budget hotel and bought a one-way train ticket. I was a software engineer.

Always be crazy

Let me start with a confession. I am not a computer person, not a geek, not a tech head, and until it became my profession I was not an habitual coder. This is my profession, not my life. It is a profession which in many ways I love, at which I feel I have a natural aptitude, in which I am driven to excel and which has relentlessly spread its roots into every other aspect of my life. At this point, I think as clearly in code as I do in language, music or mathematics. I code for fun in my free time. My entire social circle is comprised of people either themselves in software or those I have met through them. But this is effect and not cause.

The software industry prizes above all else the bedroom coder. The impossible ideal to which all software engineers (loaded term - more of that later) must aspire is that of a young, white, male (more on that too) mathematical genius who has been sat in his bedroom since the age of 12, writing websites, games, hacking and cracking for fun, with an encyclopaedic knowledge of the Linux kernel, GPU programming, every browser Javascript bug and five years experience in whatever the latest six-month-old fad is (Mongo, Node, Docker...).

Putting aside sexism and racism (more below), consider the remainder of that list. More than enough has been written by aggrieved software engineers, casually disregarding their massive privilege and wealth and moaning about how the standard is an impossible ideal which no one can ever achieve. I have no intention of flailing my arms around in a tantrum about how difficult it has been for me to meet such obscene standards of constant technical omniscience and adroitness. Every field has its own ludicrous notion of perfection - and each is equally frustrating and unachievable. This phenomenon within software has been endless covered (_Ask HN: Why does no one realise how marvellous I am?_). I want instead to talk about how damaging that goal is - not because of the ego-bruising or psychological harm done to individuals but because of the direction it pulls the industry.

I have worked with people who reasonably closely fit the description above. They were as a rule among the people I have least respected professionally, and certainly from whom I have learnt the least. A monomaniacal adherence to the _Always Be Coding_ doctrine once openly and now implicitly pressed upon junior programmers produces only young professionals lacking severely in other equally important skills. To name a few:

1. Sometimes be listening
2. Sometimes be forward-thinking
3. Sometimes be kind
4. Sometimes be humble

Dedication and even single-mindedness can be positive qualities in the development of the skills necessary to master a discipline. Yet if you focus solely on racking up the 10,000 hours that Malcolm Gladwell says you need to change the world, do not be surprised if your colleagues find you cold, awkward and selfishly ambitious.

Human resource

Dehumanisation is the term which denotes the process of depriving a person or group of people of the qualities which make them human. The effect is to reduce empathy on the part of the observer - so that when a news article labels families fleeing civil war as cockroaches or a swarm, the reader feels little empathy for the subjects, and in consequence thinks only of themselves or their own families. It is present when soldiers kill in wars, when police racially profile suspects, when online shamings ruin the lives of perpetrators of perceived ills, and when masses of people carry out racial and cultural genocide.

On another scale entirely, it is also present when companies think in headcounts, when customer satisfaction is measured in turnover, and when project managers refer to software engineers as "resource".

The result of these forms of corporate dehumanisation are not genocide or mass persecution, but instead a slow slide into the kind of Kafkaesque spreadsheetism which dominates the modern workplace. It is a phenomenon in which vibrant, multivarious and uniquely-skilled individuals are slowly ground down into little more than an placeholder for an infinitely divisible weekly quantity of work. Endless quantification, tracking, subdivision, targeting of deadlines and burndown rates, reprioritising, reshuffling and performance-related pay leaves workers as measurable quantities, plotted on charts, cut into pieces and spread out like muck over a field of projects conceived by committee and doomed to failure.

Let me be clear. I have never done a man-day of work in my life. I have done eight Chris Loy-years of work, and in that time produced a body of labour the fruits of which could not have been produced by any other. That is not to say they are better or worse than could have been done by any other person or persons. But if you do not consider that my value in the workplace could be entirely replicated by one or more other persons working some linearly scaled quantity of my time, then please do not put my name into a blank hole on a spreadsheet, and never refer to me as a resource. I am not a stack of printer paper.

I am a white, middle-class, British, hetero, cis, Oxford-educated, able-bodied male. So with my privilege adequately checked, let's just say that there are an awful lot of people in software who are remarkably like me.

Wastage/turnover
---
I worked in my first job for five and a half years. I was an outlier, and saw roughly two to three generations of developers come and go in that time. My second job lasted two years - an average stint. My third was cut short at just eight months (see below), but even in that short time I had seen some developers join and then leave a small team.

The software industry has a problem with turnover.
